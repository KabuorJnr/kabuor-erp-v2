// Kabuor ERP's privacy notice and terms of service, written for Kenyan law (Data Protection Act 2019 and its 2021
// regulations, Tax Procedures Act, Consumer Protection Act). Plain language first: a shop owner should understand
// what happens to their data and their customers' and employees' data. Each document opens with the short version,
// then numbered sections with a contents list. The contact email, the host and the database region come from the
// server's settings (Legal:Email, Legal:Hosting, Legal:HostingRegion), so they're never guessed here. How long drivers'
// locations are kept is enforced by Dispatch/DriverTrailRetention.cs. Have a Kenyan advocate review both.

            <b>Profiling and automated suggestions.</b> Kabuor Intelligence groups a business’s customers (for example “best customers” or “at risk”) and its agents suggest actions such as reminders or purchase orders. These help the business decide; no decision with a legal or similarly significant effect on a person is made by the system alone. A credit limit that holds an invoice can always be overridden by a person, and you can ask the business for a human review of any decision about you (section 35 of the Act).
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Drivers.</b> A business that tracks its drivers must tell them, and use the locations only to run deliveries. The link shares only while the driver has it open on a trip that is on the road.
